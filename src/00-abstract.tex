\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we consider a MEC scenario with C-RAN architecture,
    %Based on network function virtualization (NFV), 
    where the communication data processing tasks (DTs) and general computation tasks (CTs) can be implemented by virtual BBUs (vBBUs) and virtual MEC servers (vMESs) on general-purposed processors, respectively.
