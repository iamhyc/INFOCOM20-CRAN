\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item C-RAN is the future, where functions of data processing on baseband unit (BBU) should be implemented in a centralized and virtualized manner;
	\item Motivation: a) virtualization of CRAN on general-purpose processors (GPPs) together with MEC is better than no virtualization, which benifits from energy saving, network simplicity and dynamic resource allocation \cite{cran-survey}.
	\item In this paper, we propose a novel framework where both BBU tasks and general edge computing tasks are processed simultaneously in a homogeneous edge cloud with general-purposed processors.
	% By applying resource split between vBBU and vMC, the resource split between DT and CT is implemented. {So, why not just split computation resource for DT and CT?}
